An extension for browsers like Firefox, Chrome and Opera that changes X back to Twitter.

## About ReTwitterify
This is a test extension to turn X back to Twitter. <br>
It changes the logo from the new X back to the bird, the site title to whatever page + Twitter instead of + X, the favicon from the X to the bird.
